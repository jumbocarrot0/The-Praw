The \"if any\" clause is puzzling. If it is trying to say \"if there are any captured ships\" then it is unnecessary, because if the flare was used then there will be captured ships. On the other hand, if it is trying to say \"if their owners have any colonies\" then it is starting a job it doesn't finish since it does not define what we should do if one or more owners do not have any colonies. This situation (like dozens of others) simply defaults to the general rule that if you are supposed to return ships to colonies and have none, you send your ships to the warp.

Macron's revision history is a bit complicated. In pre-release marketing, FFG previewed a version on their website that said, in part, \"When you are a main player or ally, use this power after allies are invited. If you are the offense or an ally, you may only send one ship into the encounter.\" Players pointed out that this use of the power (in the Alliance phase) came too late to restrict the offense to just one ship in the gate. FFG changed the card prior to printing, revising the text to distinguish between the offense and non-offense players and adding a Launch icon to the alien sheet (but forgetting to include Alliance on the Super flare). The printed version queued up the 4x ship value in the launch or alliance phase and did not require the power to be further used when encounter totals were being calculated. In the FAQ, they revised Macron again so that the power was used again \"after cards are revealed,\" allowing Macron to be zapped to reset its ship value to 1. However, they mysteriously deleted the word \"ships\" from the first sentence and forgot to add the necessary Reveal icon. In the second printing, FFG used the FAQ errata and restored the word \"ships,\" but still missed the icons on both the alien sheet and the flare. The clarified version here corrects those errors and eliminates unnecessary redundancy.",

(The Super flare must be used before Oracle plays their encounter card, so it can't wait until the Reveal phase. This error probably occurred because the flare was not revisited when the use of the base power was moved from Reveal to Planning. The opponent is not actually \"revealing\" their card yet, but rather they are playing it in such a way that the other players know what it is.

Collectible objects: a card at random from a hand, a ship from the warp, the top card from a set of essence cards, an empty planet from that player's system, a facedown, un-researched tech card, or a token on that player's alien sheet, including special tokens understood to be on the sheet, e.g. those of Fire Dancer, Grudge, or Particle. You cannot take a token if doing so would make the alien power completely unusable. You may not look at facedown collected objects. Each object you have collected adds 1 to your total when you are the defense.\n\nYou may release object(s) as part of a deal with any player. Also, when you are not a main player, during the alliance phase you may release objects in trades. These trades may be suggested by any player, must involve the release of one or more objects, and may include anything that could be given as part of a deal; however, only you may gain a foreign colony from such a trade. You must accept a simple trade of a foreign colony for an owner's object. You may use this power to finalize each alliance-phase trade. Each released object is restored to its original purpose and location and its ID ship returns to any of its owner's colonies.",
