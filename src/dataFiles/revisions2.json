That player must either remove all of their ships from the encounter and return them to their colonies or allow you to look at a number of random cards in their hand up to the number of ships that they had in the encounter and take one card of your choice.\n\nIf all of a main player's ships are removed, they continue the encounter with zero ships. If all of an ally's ships are removed, they are no longer an ally."
