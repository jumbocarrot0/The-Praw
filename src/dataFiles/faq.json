However, if the FAQ ruling is talking more generally about any power effect, then Warhawk would trump the other two; Bleeding Heart and The Cult use the word 'becomes' which matches that on Retreats, Safeguards, etc. implying that it occurs before any powers trigger (like Warhawk), so Warhawk would trigger later.\n\nIf you find yourself in a game with The Cult and Warhawk, best to hash out which interpretation your group will use before game start."

However, if the FAQ ruling is talking more generally about any power effect, then Warhawk would trump the other two; Bleeding Heart and The Cult use the word 'becomes' which matches that on Retreats, Safeguards, etc. implying that it occurs before any powers trigger (like Warhawk), so Warhawk would trigger later.\n\nIf you find yourself in a game with The Cult and Warhawk, best to hash out which interpretation your group will use before game start."

However, if the FAQ ruling is talking more generally about any power effect, then Warhawk would trump the other two; Bleeding Heart and The Cult use the word 'becomes' which matches that on Retreats, Safeguards, etc. implying that it occurs before any powers trigger (like Warhawk), so Warhawk would trigger later.\n\nIf you find yourself in a game with The Cult and Warhawk, best to hash out which interpretation your group will use before game start."
