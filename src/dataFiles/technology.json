The original text is trying to let the player use his researching ships \"from this tech card,\" but it is impossible for there to be any ships on this card when it is used. The rulebook makes it clear that when a tech is completed, its researching ships must be returned to other colonies before using the tech. In most cases this is not a problem, though: since the card allows moving ships from any of the player's colonies, he can in fact use his (former) research ships anyway from the colonies he sent them to instead of \"from this tech card.\" Thus, this part of the tech's text (say that three times fast) is completely unnecessary \u00e2\u20ac\u201d except in the rare situation where a player has no colonies at all for his ships to land on, or when Engineer is using his power to research this tech. Were it not for these rare situations, we could simply delete the incorrect phrase, \"or this tech card.\" Instead, to prevent the researching ships from all going to the warp in the first rare case, a new sentence is required to make the card work as intended. This leaves us one remaining question: \"Since Coldsleep Ship requires 9 ships to research and allows 4 of them to go onto the new colony, what happens to the other 5 if the player has no other colonies?\" To answer that question, the revision presented here allows all nine ships to land on the new colony when the player has no other option."
