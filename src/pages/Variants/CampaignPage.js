      <p className="text-light">The Campaign variant is the box-featured variant of Cosmic Odyssey, designed to allow players to easily explore that expansion's 8+ variants.
        <br /><br />
        In this variant, players will play through four games of Cosmic. Throught the campaign players will add aliens to their coalitions, earn prizes for future games, endure through ages that introduce random variants, culminating in an epic and crazy finale.

        This page will detail the rules of a campaign, but will also act as a hub page for other campaign components, such as envoys, age cards, etc..

            <p className="text-light">Setup for a game in the campaign is similar to advanced setup for the base game with a few changes. Perform the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
              <li className="text-light"><strong>Choose Player Color:</strong> In the first game of the campaign, each player chooses a player color they will use for the remainder of the campaign.</li>

              <li className="text-light"><strong>Set Up Warp, Planets, Ships, and Colonies:</strong> Each player takes their planets and ships, places their planets in front of them and stacks four of their ships on each of their planets. Then, place the warp in the center of the play area. Finally, players place their colony markers at “0” on the colony track.</li>
              <li className="text-light"><strong>Prepare Decks:</strong> Take the three destiny cards that correspond to each player's color and shuffle them with the wild and special destiny cards to create the destiny deck.</li>

              <li className="text-light"><strong>Prepare the Variant(s):</strong> Find the corresponding rules for the variant listed on the age card located on the same page as the alien selection method and follow the instructions.</li>
              <ul>
                <li className="text-light">These rules typically alter setup by adding a new component, such as a deck of cards.</li>

                <li className="text-light">Master cards are awarded to the winning players at the end of the game, and its effect is used during the finale.</li>
                <li className="text-light"><Badge color="danger">Finale</Badge> <strong>However</strong>, for the finale, players will finally use their earned master cards. In the order that they were acquired, each master card that was claimed is read aloud. Each player that marked a “1” during that age resolves its effect starting with the first player and going clockwise. Master cards generally grant the players a unique benefit that reflects the age in which they dominated.</li>
                <li className="text-light"><Badge color="danger">Finale</Badge> After resolving the master cards, identify the player that marked a square around their score during the first game. That player draws two wrench cards from the wrench deck, chooses one to resolve, and shuffles the other into the deck. Then, they read the chosen card's text aloud and follow its instructions. Repeat this process for each of the other played games.</li>

            <ul>
              <li className="text-light">After setup, the game proceeds like any other game of Cosmic Encounter. The game still ends like a normal game when either a player establishes their fifth foreign colony or achieves an alternative win condition. That player is the winner of the game. Then, the score is determined.</li>
              <li className="text-light">Some cards other than age cards may introduce additional variants. These cards will include a page number reference of where the rules for that variant are located. For example, if a card adds the Reward Deck variant, it includes (🕮10) to guide players to turn to page 10 in this guide.</li>
              <li className="text-light">At the end of each game except the finale, every player is given a ranking based on 1) if they won the game and 2) their score during that game based upon the current age.</li>
              <ul>
                <li className='text-light'>Write each player's rank down on the campaign log. This is important to determine prizes in future games.</li>
                <li className='text-light'>The player(s) that won the game (via the standard method or otherwise) are given a rank of "1", regardless of their score.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li className='text-light'>If a player wins a game using an alternative win condition, instead of determining their score, they are treated as having scored one point more than the player who has the true highest score.</li>
                </ul>
                <li className='text-light'>Among the non-winning players, the one with the highest-score writes a "2" in the campaign log, then the one with the next highest score writes a “3,” and so on.</li>
                <li className='text-light'>Each player earns a score based on the current age's scoring criteria. This score is used to determine the ranking of each player. The age card being used identifies which parts of the game award players with points.</li>
                <li className='text-light'>If any players have the exact same score, starting with the offense and going counter-clockwise among the tied players, the player that was closest to the offense is ranked higher.</li>
                <li className='text-light'>The lowest-ranked player draws a square around their rank that game to indicate that they have "earned" a wrench card in the finale, and that they will go first during the next game.</li>
                <li className='text-light'>The highest-ranked player draws a circle around their rank that game to indicate that they will select the age card next game. If multiple players had the "1" rank, ties are broken based upon those players' scores.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li className='text-light'><strong>The Praw house rule:</strong> Players who earned a "1" rank but did not draw a circle should draw a star to indicate that they still earn a master card in the finale.</li>

              <li className='text-light'>After each player has recorded their ranking, they clean up the game to prepare for the next game of the campaign. To clean up, the players return each component back to its corresponding deck or pile, with the following exceptions:</li>
