              <li className="text-light">If a variant provides a special action, the ship's owner may activate this single-use effect by flipping the ship marker facedown. The owner may then “recharge” the special action for re-use by turning the marker faceup again whenever the special ship is retrieved from the warp, or if the owner does not have a second encounter on their turn.</li>
              <li className="text-light">If a special ship is captured or removed from the game, when its owner retrieves a different ship from the warp during their own regroup phase, that player may place their marker on it, faceup, to create a replacement special ship.</li>

            <p className="text-light">These fan rules tweak the official rules slightly to adapt them for a card-based version of special ships. This gives each player's special ship an individual ability.</p>
            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <ul>
              <li className="text-light">Each player takes their color ship marker and places it faceup on one of their ships.</li>
              <li className="text-light">Shuffle the special ship deck and deal each player 2 special ship cards. Each player chooses one to keep and discards the rest.</li>
              <li className="text-light">Once all players have chosen a special ship card, they are all revealed.</li>

            <ul>
              <li className="text-light">Each player can use their special ship's ability card for as long as their ship is in the game.</li>
              <li className="text-light">A special ship card has a special named ability, which requires the ship to be exhausted to use.</li>
              <li className="text-light">Some special ships also have a <strong>Passive</strong> ability, which always functions even if the ship is exhausted.</li>
              <li className="text-light">If a special ship is exhausted, its marker is flipped facedown.</li>
              <li className="text-light">A player may “recharge” their special ship by forfeiting to have a second encounter, flipping their special ship's marker face up and letting it be exhausted again.</li>
              <li className="text-light">A special ship is automatically recharged when it is retrieved from the warp.</li>
              <li className="text-light">If a player's special ship is captured or removed from the game, the special ship marker is discarded.</li>
              <li className="text-light">At the start of a player's turn, if they have a special ship card but do not have a special ship marker on any of their ships in the game (including those in the warp), then they may place their marker on any one of their ships, designating it as their new special ship.</li>
