      <p className="text-light">Hazards are an official variant introduced in Cosmic Conflict. The variant adds an additional hazard deck which is drawn from whenever a destiny card with a hazard warning is drawn (which is roughly 25% of the destiny deck).
        <br />
        Cosmic Conflict introduced 17 hazard cards, 8 of which had duplicated to create a 24-card deck. Cosmic Odyssey introduced an additional 26 cards to bring the total up to 50 hazard cards.</p>
      <h2>Trivia</h2>
      <ul>
        <li className='text-light'>Hazards are likely a remake of the <a rel="external" href="http://warp.redamedia.com/comets.php3">'Comets'</a> variant from the Mayfair edition. Comets were cards with special effects that would be shuffled into the destiny deck, and would trigger alongside a standard destiny draw.</li>
        <li className="text-light">Alt-Hazards are based off <a rel="external" href="http://warp.redamedia.com/armist.php3">'Armistices'</a>, which were a homebrew variant that involved extra cards shuffled into the destiny deck that would give the offense an optional bonus, if they accepted it..</li>

            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <ul>
              <li className="text-light">Shuffle the hazard deck and place it near the warp.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <ul>
              <li className="text-light">During the destiny phase, if a player draws a destiny card with a hazard warning on it, a hazard card is drawn at the end of the destiny phase, regardless of whether that destiny card is used or redrawn.</li>
              <ul>
                <li className="text-light">Hazard warnings beyond the first drawn during the same encounter have no additional effect.</li>
              </ul>
              <li className="text-light">Hazard cards that are drawn take effect for the current encounter and, unless they are marked otherwise, are discarded to a hazard deck discard pile. Any abilities that affect discard piles do not affect this discard pile.</li>
              <li className="text-light">When the hazard deck has no cards in it, shuffle its discard pile to make a new hazard deck.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hazard Types</h3>
            <p className="text-light">Cosmic Conflict had two types of hazards, and Cosmic Odyssey added two new types of hazard cards.</p>
            <ul>
              <li className="text-light">Temporary, which is the standard hazard card that is not labeled otherwise. When such a card is drawn, its effect is resolved and discarded.</li>
              <li className="text-light">Permanent, which are hazards card that have a red bar that reads "Remains in play". These remain in play and have a continuous effect. Some have a condition on the card that cause the hazard to be discarded.</li>
              <li className="text-light">Semi-Permanent, which are hazard cards that have a yellow bar that reads "Semi-Permanent". These remain in play and have a continuous effect. When another Permanent or Semi-Permanent hazard is placed in the play area, the previous card is discarded.</li>
              <ul>
                <li className="text-light">The Praw recommends to not discard a semi-permanent hazard when a permanent hazard is added, but instead to treat 'The Entropy Beast', 'The Witness' and 'The Cosmic Guardian' as semi-permanent. This makes 'Alliance' have no effect on Semi-Permanent hazards.</li>
              </ul>
              <li className="text-light">Alt-Hazards, which give the offense an alternative option to having an encounter. If the offense chooses to use the alt-hazard effect, it ends that playerâ€™s encounter and provides a different effect for all other players.</li>
            </ul>
